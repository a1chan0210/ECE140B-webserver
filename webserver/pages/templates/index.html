        <h3>Team: Anthony Chan, Kathy Li, Kendrick Nguyen, Alex Hernandez-Perez</h3>

        <p class = "description">
            Our project, Pep Pets, is a digital handheld pet marketed towards young children around ages 8 - 13. It is a digital pet that
            needs to be taken care of and incentivizes children to become more active, social and learn about the responsibilities of raising
            a pet.
